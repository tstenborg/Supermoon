# Supermoon

- SuperMoon.rmd &nbsp;&nbsp; R code, intended for use in RStudio.<br />
- SuperMoon.md &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Github-browsable code with example results, including 2001&ndash;2100 supermoon listing.

The R program is supported by files implementing ELP-2000/82 (the Fortran program elp82b_2.f and associated data files ELP1 to ELP36, see Chapront-Touz√©, M., & Chapront, J. 1983, A&A, 124, 50). It's assumed elp82b_2.f has been compiled into "elp82b_2" (either a shared object on Unix/Linux or dll on Windows), in the same directory as the R program. An elp82b_2.dll, compiled with MinGW-w64, has been included in this repository and may save some Windows users from compiling elp82b_2.f themselves.
